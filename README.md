# WoWAllItems
Since I could not find any updated item ids that I can work on, I created one myself. all.txt contains all item ids and auctionable.txt contains only auctionable item ids. Currently all.txt have 113495 item ids and auctionable.txt have 25150 item ids. These file is updated as 20 January 2018. I will be updating as new patches comes. If you find any missing item ids feel free to add.
